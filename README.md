## What is this?

This repository is a the source code for a [Discord](https://discord.com) bot. The `discord.js` library is used to contact the Discord bot API. This allows for an easy integration into node.js.

## What does it do?

Currently there are no plans to publically host this bot. This being my first actual coding project it is mainly to try out new Discord features and improve on my programming skills. This bot doesn't focus on any special commands or a specify category of features. I have mostly focused processing user input and responses.
Feel free to check out the available commands by opening the according files in the [commands](https://github.com/NilsPvR/tree/main/commands) folder.

## Contribution

Since this project has been made so that I can improve my skills I am not interested in any Pull requests. However I am open for feedback. Feel free to open a new Issue if you notice anything I should change.
